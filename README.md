# Challenges to discover C
*Since I'm learning C, some programs could be more optimized. If so, feel free to suggest an improved version of the program.*

## Explanation
This repository contains a collection of programs written in C. The programs are divided into four levels of difficulty: easy, medium, hard and expert. The programs are designed to help me learn C programming language. If you want to complete challenges with increasing difficulty, don't hesitate to do them as well. The instructions for each program are in the README.md file of each folder.
